# Overview {#overview}

GIS-based vector data provide a complex set of data structures. Generally in R these are stored in nested lists where the
physical structure of the data represents an interpretation of the logical structures in the data. 

Nested lists can be seen in another *inside-out* way as *relations*,  as data stored in multiple data frames. Various packages provide conversions between these views, and there are good tools for transferring between forms, but there is no overall approach that works in the general case. There are opportunities for extension and improvement to the handling of data structures with conversion tools. Here we focus on GIS vector data to show the limitations of the nested structures, and how being able to flip between representations provides some general added power.

A Spatial object is a complex nested list of coordinates stored in matrices with S4 classes, with each top-level item linked by ID to rows in a data frame. A newer form to replace Spatial that handles more kinds of data sets is simple features in sf. Here the coordinates are in nested lists of matrices, except for one case where a single POINT is an atomic vector.  The `sf` package stores each object with its data frame row rather than by a remote link ID, and the package is compliant with the simple features standard which removes some ambiguities that existed in `sp`. The simple features approach is more aligned with the tidyverse principles, but does this by way of a formal API to switch from lists to data frames in pre-specified ways. 

We can define an *always data frame* analog to these data structures in two quite different ways. 

* nested data frames stored in one single data frame
* multiple data frames without nesting

The first approach is good because there is a single lowest level data frame object and there's no need to deal with more than one object. 

The latter approach encodes the nested relations by way of database ID techniques, and because each structure is a single table this is easily transferred from and to databases. This approach also provides extra flexibility for spatial data structures, that  don't fit in the simple features framework and that are generally precluded by nested structures. 

### Terminology

Types of tables are 

* **Object table** (some GIS call this "Feature" table, ggplot2 calls it "metadata table")

* **Branch-coordinate table** - (X, Y, ...) ID, part-ID, part-parent-ID

* **Branch-table** - part-ID, parent-ID

* **Coordinate-table** - (X, Y, ...) part-ID

* **Vertex-table** - purely geometry, with vertex-ID

* **Primitive-table** - tables of primitives, with primitive-ID 

* **Link-table** - link tables provide many-to-one relations for branches and primitives

(It's not obvious which IDs to label here since it's different when nesting means you don't necessarily need the one-level-up ID explicitly)

Branch-coordinate table is a combination of Branch- and Coordinate-table. 

Use "Branch" as a general term for "part" or "piece" of an individual Object (rather than "ring", "linestring", "coordinate" in the specific cases). Branch really means "path" as in a line-string path, or a polygon ring path - but can refer to a single vertex. 

Use "Primitive" for the general case, 0D-Primitive is single-vertex coordinate, 1D-Primitive is two-vertex 

There might be a separate table for each kind of primitive, and there are long- and wide- forms for the primitives link tables. 

Branch-link tables must always be long because they have varying numbers of coordinates. 

## Two kinds of nesting for Spatial / sf

Nest once, so each row has its own Branch-coordinate table. 

Nest twice so each row has a Branch-coordinate table, which in turn has its Coordinate-table

## Inside-out view 

Row-bind all matching-types tables together, in single-nesting this is the fortify approach used in `ggplot2` for `sp`, in double-nesting this gives us three tables. 

We name these inside-out, multiple-table approaches: 

* Bespoke hierarchical (nested lists of things, sp, sf)
* Fortify - two tables, Object and Branch-Coordinate. 
* Branch - three tables, Object, Branch, Coordinate

Once in Branch form, we can go further by converting into Primitives form, which provides data structures and techniques not supported by simple features or any general GIS standard. 


The steps to convert to Primitives are: 

* de-duplicate vertices in geometry-space[^1] 
* convert from  from path to line segment model (PSLG, 1D Primitives, same meaning)


There are only 0D- and 1D- primitives in simple features (caveat for exotic types that are really stretches of the branch-based standard). 

The line-segment model, or Planar Straight Line Graph (PSLG) can be used to generate two more forms: 

* identify 3-way vertex-segmnet relations to generate arc-node model (TopoJSON)
* generate 2D primitives from line segments via modified-Delaunay (RTriangle), or ear-clipping (rgl)


Now we have the following main types of representation

* Bespoke hierarchical
* Nested data frames (single or double)
* Fortify
* Branch
* Primitives

Each of these forms has direct applications for a variety of tasks, either for transferring between forms or for applications that are more efficient in a given form. 

## Notes

[^1]: De-duplication may be in any dimensional geometric space, but for simple features this would rarely make sense to not be X,Y.
