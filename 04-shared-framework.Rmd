# A shared framework for disparate spatial systems in R?

## Nesting

tidyr and gggeom show that nesting can be used to always work in a single table, and sp can be emulated with single-nesting of the fortify table, or more closely with double nesting, first on object and then on piece. gggeom keeps attributes in separate lists, in order to allow for different numbers of values in each (though tables can do that too . . .). 

The main issues with nesting into one table, with nested components, are that: 

* it doesn't allow for many-to-one de-duplication indexing (unless the nested component stores an index to another table - but that's not one  table). 

* it's not readily backed by a database

A system of normalized tables is ready for transfer to a database, and can be read directly from a database *without any specialist tools for special types*

## Decomposition to relational tables

We have seen that a wide variety of data configurations can be converted to a set of relational tables and that these give systematic and straightforward pathways for reconstructing other forms. 
This provides the opportunity for an API where specialized packages provide the special methods to convert from and to the shared form, and so many conversions then become automatic and easy. 

Can we create simple idioms to encode decomposition from recursive objects generally? The cascading semi-join makes for very simple propagation of a subset from teh object table down through the other tables, and a cascading inner join automatically builds the right spbabel/fortify table that can be used directly, or as a stepping stone to constructing recursive list forms. 

The tidy initiative has show that these high-level processes can be abstracted into commonly used tools, but so far it's  been about tidying up model outputs and reshaping between long and wide forms.
